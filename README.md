# iceproject
A browser extension created by the Imgur Community for use on imgur.

# Info
The plugin is written with jQuery. There are several improvements that can be made to the current structure. In the next
few days I'll be adding comments and seperating and modularizing (is that a word?) code. 

Right now, the extension has support for a panel/popup (for the extension icon in the top right of Chrome), due to the current 
messaging system. Also, it was written in a way that it should eventually support chrome.storage.sync, so tags would synchronize
between machines. It has a lot of capabilities, so all we need now is for some requests from the community (as well as those of 
you who are reading).

At some point, we can port it to firefox.

# How to install locally
1. In Chrome, paste "chrome://extensions" into the URL bar and hit enter. Keep this tab open.
2. Clone this repo. 
3. Drag the "main" folder onto the chrome extensions tab.
4. Congrats!

# Goals
Goals of the project in no particular order:
- Make some sick code. Good style. Good memes. This extension is our chance to code for fun and to make a difference in the community.
- Help the community and stuff.
- Express ourselves! Art through code.
- Learn a lot in the process.

Make sure to:
- Keep things constructive. We're all here to learn.
- Keep an open mind!

# A few words
Hi! 

So, I initially started work on the extension to add the capability of tagging/sorting favorites. At first, I thought it would be
really easy, just code tags and that would be it. That was 2 months ago... Anyway, I worked on it on and off, and kept reworking it 
and re-writing the system so it would work better until I had an idea. What if this was for more than just tags? 

What if... we made it so you could upload custom loading gifs to share with everyone (that would replace the default ones), or made the 
whole page alert you and turn red or flash a huge Michael Cera if you come across a post by ANewBadlyPhotoshoppedPhotoofMichaelCeraEveryday 
in User Sub, OR what if we wanted to make it spookier, and actually HIDE his name and make it a random username so nobody would expect it... 
or what if we somehow made something... I don't know what, but an opportunity for imgur-non-coders to learn how to code? I thought, "we 
could do a lot with this". That day, I thought of a bunch of different names, but Imgur Community Extension stuck, mostly cause the 
initials spelt "ICE", and I thought it was super cool, pun intended.

Nowadays, it seems like people only learn how to code to work for a big company (big $$$) or to make the next UBER or something. 
This is an opportunity to experiment and code whatever you feel like coding not for the big bucks or fame (well, maybe for fame, or at
least for internet points), but to learn from each other and to have fun coding.

If you wanna help out or have any questions/comments/concerns, add me on Skype (kyrofox) or Steam (shottysteve) or just sit tight here. 
I don't have much yet, but I have a feeling we're going to get a lot of feature requests; we can all talk about it then.

Enough words, lets code!

TL;DR: Let's code for fun. Add me or stay posted if you want to participate.
